### BASIC COMPUTER TERMS

#### Computer
A computer is a machine or device that performs processes, calculations and operations based on instructions provided by a software or hardware program. They are designed to execute applications and provide a variety of solutions by combining integrated hardware and software components. Modern computers include laptop, ATM and also many smart devices (smartphones, smart TV, smart watches, game console and smart appliances etc)

#### Hardware:
Hardware consists of the physical components of your computer. If you can kick it, punch it, or pick it up to throw it, it’s hardware. For e.g. Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor are hardware

#### Software	
A software is a program application; which provides the computer with step-by-step instructions to perform a specific task. A computer cannot function without software. Examples of software are the installable or default programs of the OS(Widows/Linux/Mac).
Installable programs applications include games, Microsoft office and Google Chrome. Default program applications are by default installed in OS like TextEdit/Notepad, Finder/File Explorer, System Preferences/Settings. Some defaults programs are usually running in the background to support all these programs.

#### CPU 
The central processing unit or CPU, also known as the microprocessor or processor. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. Some are known as i5 or i7, dual core or quad core processors.

#### Operating System  
The operating system (OS) of a computer is the software that communicates with the computer hardware. No software can run on the computer without the operating system. Windows, Linux and MacOS are mostly common OS using now a days. For smartphones, you must have heard about android and iOS(iphone's OS).

#### File 
A file is a block of information that includes word documents, pictures, music, etc. Each file is differentiated with the help of a unique file name. Each file has a extension that define it's type. Images can be denoted as JPEG, PNG, GIFs. Text files can be TXT, DOCX or PDF, music or sounds can be MP3 and videos are mostly MP4.

#### Folder 
A folder is a system that helps in organizing files, programs and projects on the computer. It is similar to organizing files on a shelf in your cabinet. 

#### Memory	
Chips/units that hold information that the computer needs to use. Similar to how a human stores all memory into the brain, a computer also the memory. These chips are connected directly to the Microprocessor.

#### Modem 
A modem is something that is connected to a computer to connect it to the internet or other networks. This is typically in the form of a small box that you get from your provider. You must have a modem in your home which provides wifi signals to your computer and smartphone.

#### Hard Disk	
The Hard Disk is where the data is stored within the computer. All your files (images, music and softwares) and also your OS are stored in hard drive

 
### Web Development

#### Web Development
Web development refers to building, creating, and an maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web programming, and database management. Let us study all these terms in detail.

#### How do websites work?
All websites, at their most basic, are just a bunch of files that are stored on a computer called a server. This server is connected to the internet. You can then load that website through a browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) on your computer or your phone. Your browser is also called the client in this situation.
So, every time that you’re on the internet, you (the client) are getting and loading data (like cat pics) from the server, as well as submitting data back to the server (load moar cat pics!) This back and forth between the client and the server is the basis of the internet.

#### Web Designer
A web designer is someone who is both creative and technically inclined, and uses both these attributes to build or redesign websites. The web designer has the ability to understand what is needed to make a website functional and easy to use, but at the same time make it aesthetically appealing to the user.

#### Web Developer
A web developer is one that develops applications and functionality for the Internet.

#### Code editor
When you build a website, the most essential tool that you will use is your code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment). This tool allows you to write the markup and code that will make up the website. For example when you want to write code in html, you use Visual Studio, so Visual Studio is an example of code editor. Other code editors include sublime text and atom etc.

#### Front-end Development
The front end of a website is the part you interact with. In simpler words, everything that you can actually see on a website when you're navigating around the Internet, from fonts and colors to dropdown menus are a part of front end. Example, when you navigate to youtube to see the red header, the search option box, all of it is part of front end.
The front-end of a website is made up of three types of files: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These files are what is loaded in the browser, on the client side.

##### HTML
> HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of all websites. It’s the main file type that is loaded in your browser when you look at a website. The HTML file contains all the content on the page, and it uses tags to denote different types of content.

##### CSS
> CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, lets you style that HTML content so it looks nice and fancy. You can add colors, custom fonts, and layout the elements of your website.

##### Javascript 
> JavaScript is a programming language that was designed to run in the browser. Using JavaScript, you can make your website dynamic, meaning it will respond to different inputs from the user, or other sources.

#### Tools
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the basic building blocks of front-end web development. In addition to them, there are a few other tools that will help you build websites easily. These tools include additional packages, You can think about them like plugins– instead of writing everything from scratch, you can use helpful utilities that other people have written already.

#### Version control
Version control (also called source control) is a system that keeps track of every code change that you make in your project files. You can even go back to a previous change if you make a mistake. It’s almost like having infinite save points for your project. Similar to how you have cntrl+z command to undo a mistake or cntrl+y command to redo something, version control also allows you to undo or redo changes in your project.

##### Git
> The most popular version control system is an open source system called Git. Using Git, you can store all your files and their change history in collections called repositories.

#### Back-end Development
Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. In simple words it is the  behind-the-scenes activities that happen when you  perform any action on a website. For example when you login to your account, the status that is returned to you is based on the authentication measures done by the logics written in the application. All this logic part is back end.
The back-end, or server-side of web development, is made up of three main components: the server, a server-side programming language, and the database.

#### Server
A server is a computer that has specific programs and/or hardware which enables it to offer services to other computers (clients). There are different types and capabilities of servers. Think about transportation. We can think of transportation as anything that can move something or someone from one location to the other. A bicycle can move one person, a car can move four people etc. They are all modes of transport, but each has a different capacity. The same applies to servers. Servers are responsible for communicating request from the user and getting response from the database. Fo example when you login to your account, your request first reaches the server from where it goes to the database to fetch data.

#### Programming language
On the server, you need to use a programming language to write the functions and logic for your application. The server then compiles your code and conveys the result back to the user. There are many programming languages such as C#, Node js and PHP etc.

#### Database
Database is where you store information for your website. It is simply an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. It's some sort of tables of information stored in the applications to store applications data permanently(unless you delete it yourself). For example, in any games you add your name and when ever you open it it shows your previous score. The data (information) is stored in the database of the application. You can think it the hard drive of the software.
